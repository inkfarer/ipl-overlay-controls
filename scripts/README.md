# Scripts

Small scripts to help with tasks not doable by NodeCG or `nodecg-cli`.

Any of these scripts may be executed with the `--verbose` parameter to enable additional error logging.

## update-dashboard.bat

Attempts to get the latest version of the dashboard.

## update-bundles.bat

Attempts to update NodeCG bundles depending on ipl-overlay-controls.

## clear-replicants.bat

Clears ipl-overlay-controls replicant data (Saved teams/matches/rounds, some configuration, etc.). 
Only use if you know what you are doing, or if you have been specifically instructed to execute this script!

## start.bat

Launches NodeCG. It is recommended to create a shortcut to this file somewhere easy to access.
